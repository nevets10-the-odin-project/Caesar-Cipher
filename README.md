# Project: Caesar Cipher

https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-caesar-cipher

## Introduction

By now you should feel pretty good working with strings, arrays and hashes. We’ll do a couple of classic “intro to programming” problems in the next few lessons to help solidify your knowledge and get warmed up to working on small projects. You’ll need to rely on some of your basic knowledge of conditionals and flow control from the prep work but you shouldn’t need to do anything you haven’t seen before.

## Post project review

This was a fairly straightforward project. However, writing in Ruby feels kind of awkward coming from JavaScript. It reminds me of PL/SQL a little with the block format.
